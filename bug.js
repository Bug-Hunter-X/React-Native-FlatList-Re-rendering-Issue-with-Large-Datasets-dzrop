This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the `renderItem` function is called repeatedly for the same item, leading to performance issues and incorrect rendering. This is often seen when using dynamic data or when the data changes frequently.  The `keyExtractor` prop is not correctly identifying unique items, causing the `FlatList` to re-render unnecessarily. Here's an example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
/>
```

In this example, if `myData` contains duplicate objects, or if the objects don't have a unique identifier, the `FlatList` won't know which items to update and which to keep, causing the re-rendering problem.
