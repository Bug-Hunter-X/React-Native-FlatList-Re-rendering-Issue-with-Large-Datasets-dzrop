The solution is to provide a proper `keyExtractor` function to the `FlatList` component. This function should return a unique key for each item in the dataset.  A common approach is to use the item's ID.  If your data doesn't have an ID, you'll need to add one.

Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
/>
```

This ensures that the `FlatList` can efficiently track which items have changed and which have not, preventing unnecessary re-renders.  If your items don't have a unique `id` property, you might need to generate one.  For example, you can use a library like `uuid` to create unique identifiers for each item.

Alternatively, you could also use the index as a key, but this is generally discouraged as it can lead to issues if the order of items changes.  This should only be used as a last resort if generating unique IDs is not feasible.
